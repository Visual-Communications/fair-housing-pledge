Dear Heroku customer,

We have identified you as the owner of, or collaborator on, the following apps that have the mLab MongoDB add-on installed.

The mLab team has chosen to discontinue this add-on. The mLab MongoDB add-on will be removed from all Heroku apps on November 10, 2020. We advise you to remove the mLab MongoDB add-on yourself before September 1, 2020 via the Dashboard or the CLI.

Next Steps
You may wish to consider an alternative add-on from the Heroku Elements marketplace. As of the date of this email, ObjectRocket makes available an add-on on the Heroku Elements Marketplace that you may wish to consider. For customers considering remaining with mLab/Atlas, information can be found here.

Please note that the ObjectRocket for MongoDB add-on is not provided by Salesforce or Heroku. Salesforce makes no warranties or guarantees regarding this add-on, and it is defined as a “Non-SFDC Application” in the Master Subscription Agreement found at https://hello.heroku.com/e/36622/company-msa-jsp/lv2qdz/961848437?h=k7OOzoiWAfCK2FUw01Sy0pNOzM7nv7mJtiXB3GLLvHI. You should undertake your own evaluation of this add-on and determine whether it is suitable for your specific business needs. Please contact ObjectRocket directly to find out more information.

Note: Because the mLab MongoDB add-on affects customer data, you may consider taking preemptive action to avoid impact to your customer data. This includes, but is not limited to, the potential loss of access to customer data, the deletion of customer data, or the risk of a feature or functionality becoming no longer available due to the mLab MongoDB add-on shutdown.


Thank You,
Heroku Ecosystem Team
